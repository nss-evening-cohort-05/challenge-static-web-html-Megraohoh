<!-- Article element containing your bio -->
	<p>I&#8217ve made my home base in Nashville, Tennessee. The current chapter of my life is marked with restlessness and the need to walk the world a bit. The solution was to start a journey into tech, a journey that opened a fascination with the way our world&#8217s inhabitants communicate. I was hooked and wanted to begin building and designing sites that would be a part of that system of communication.</p>
